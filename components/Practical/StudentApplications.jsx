            <p>
              There are multiple reasons to participate. First of all, you can improve your skills
              under the supervision of several experienced coaches. Secondly, since you’ll be making
              a real product or service, it looks great on your resume and you’ll expand your
              network. Thirdly, you’ll surely make some new friends too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sounds awesome, no? And we didn’t even get to the best part yet: osoc is completely
              free. Even better, you are getting paid! This programme could replace your summer job.
              Enhancing your skills, making new friends and cashing in some money too? Sounds like a
              good plan, right?

              All students will work in teams on different open innovation projects provided by
              partnering organisations, companies and governments. The goal is to complete these
              projects by the end of the programme and turn them into real-world products and
              services. In the end, your team will present the finished product to the partnering
              organisation and the world.
